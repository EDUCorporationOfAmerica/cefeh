						<h3> How to interact with customers properly </h3>
								
						<p>
							Customer service is important to an organization because it is often the only contact a customer has with a company. Customers are vital to an organization. Some customers spend hundreds and even thousands of dollars per year with a company. Consequently, when they have a question or product issue, they expect a company's customer service department to resolve their issues.
						</p>

						<p>

							A company with excellent customer service is more likely to get repeat business from customers. Consequently, the company will benefit with greater sales and profits. Contrarily, companies with poor customer service may lose customers, which will have a negative impact on business. It costs a lot more money for a company to acquire a customer than to retain them, due to advertising costs and the expense of sales calls. Therefore, the efforts that go into maintaining quality customer service can really pay dividends over time.

						<h3> How to do basic maintenance on the Win 7 OS </h3>

						<p>
							Most small business owners don’t know much about basic computer maintenance and as a result, their PCs slow down or crash. The real issue is neglect: failing to update security patches and antivirus software, overloading the system with trial software or running five toolbars at once in Internet Explorer.</p>

							<p> Of course, many small business owners don’t know much about cars either, but they know to give it gas, change the oil every so often and to keep an eye out for flat tires. It’s the same with PCs. You don’t need to be an expert to keep your PC in relatively good condition. You just need to perform a little basic PC maintenance and, more importantly, be observant.

								<p>Hello eager learners. This is Jalen Austin, a class 10 student at Year Up Chicago. Jalen Austin is currently a tech geek in the making. Tech-Nerd Austin was born and raised on the south-side of Chicago. His interests consist of learning information technology, playing basketball or sports in general, and writing music. Jalen's number one goal in life is to become this generations next successful CEO. He desires to set an example for kids who need guidance and show them that anything is achievable through hard work and ambition. "Dedicate yourself to success and nothing will stop you," is one of many mottos Jalen Austin lives by.</p>

 								<p>Year Up has taught him so much over the period of L&D (Learning and Development phase of Year Up). Year Up has changed Jalen Austin's whole perception of life for the better, and has exposed him to the brighter road to success in life. Year up has even inspired Jalen to create his own quote. "No matter who you are and where you come from, success is around the corner, but It is up to you to decide if you're going to turn left at the light or make a right and enjoy life." by Jalen Austin 6/30/2015. His advice to the eager learners who are interested in succeeding in life is to choose friends wisely because a humans personality is influence by the 5 people he/she hangs around and the 20 people he/she receives advice from. Choosing friends is a difficulty that Jalen Austin has faced for a long time, but Year Up Chicago has surrounded him with successful minded friends who care and wants to see him succeed. So he will.</p>

								<p>William Galllion is a Class 10 Student at Year Up Chicago. William was born and raised on the Near-North and West sides of Chicago, Illinois. He currently resides in Maywood, Illinois. William’s interests include: learning IT, playing sports, listening to music and hanging with friends and family. William’s goals include: becoming a CEO to a fortune 500 company, providing opportunities to those in need and ultimately, becoming a sports analyst for ESPN. William lives by the quote “Rise Above Hate” because he believes that there will always be doubters doubting a person’s potential, so it’s up to the person to prove his or her doubter wrong.</p>

								<p>During his time at Year Up, William has shown himself to be very resilient, hardworking and supportive of his fellow colleagues. William has demonstrated what it means to be a leader by helping his fellow colleagues keep track of their assignments, stepping up to challenging tasks and ultimately being a voice. His Year Up experience has also taught him to persevere through any obstacle. During module II of Learning and Development, William unfortunately fell below one hundred points, but he stayed afloat and due to hard work, sacrifice and support from his learning community. Two things William has taken away from his Year Up experience is to always “expect the unexpected” and to “never be afraid to take a chance”.</p>
